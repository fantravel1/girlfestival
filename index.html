            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>The best women-only festivals span every continent and genre — from legendary music gatherings and goddess retreats in North America and Europe, to transformative wellness experiences in Bali and Costa Rica, pioneering adventure festivals in Oceania, and emerging cultural celebrations across Africa and Asia. GirlFestival catalogs 250+ verified women-only festivals across 50+ countries, each vetted for safety, inclusion, and cultural integrity. The "best" festival depends on what you're seeking — music, healing, leadership, adventure, or spiritual connection.</p>

            </summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Yes — women-only music festivals exist worldwide and are growing in number and diversity. These range from large outdoor multi-day festivals featuring all-women lineups to intimate acoustic gatherings and songwriting retreats. Women-only music festivals create spaces where female artists headline by default and audiences experience live music free from the safety concerns and power dynamics common at mixed events. You'll find everything from rock and folk to electronic, world music, and classical.</p>

              <h3>How safe are women-only festivals compared to mixed events?</h3>
              <span class="faq-toggle" aria-hidden="true"></span>
            </summary>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>Women-only festivals consistently report dramatically lower rates of harassment, assault, and safety incidents compared to mixed-gender events. This is by design — with explicit consent cultures, trained safety teams, clear reporting systems, and community accountability. Attendees consistently describe feeling a level of freedom and safety they rarely experience elsewhere. GirlFestival evaluates every event's safety infrastructure across seven dimensions before listing.</p>

              <p>Attending a women-only festival solo is one of the safest and most rewarding ways to experience these events. Many attendees come alone and find instant community. Most women-only festivals are specifically designed to welcome solo travelers with buddy systems, welcome circles, and first-timer orientations. GirlFestival marks events that are "first-timer friendly" and "solo-traveler safe" to help you find your best fit.</p>

              <p>Many women-only festivals explicitly welcome queer, trans, and nonbinary attendees. GirlFestival includes a "queer-inclusive" filter so you can find events that actively celebrate LGBTQ+ identities. Each event's inclusion policy is clearly listed so you can choose spaces where you'll feel fully seen and welcomed. The women-only festival movement has deep roots in queer culture and community.</p>

              <p>Many women-only festivals offer sober-friendly or fully alcohol-free environments. GirlFestival lets you filter for sober-friendly events specifically.

              <p>Yes — there are women-only festivals and gatherings designed specifically for teens, college-age women, and young adults.
